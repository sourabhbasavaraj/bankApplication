The code has been developed in a structured way. Each classes are put into different packages which defines different logic such as the Entities and Business logic.

org.Business: This package contains all the exception classes and interfaces which hides the implementation.

org.Entites: This package contains all the code logic for the interfaces.

org.View: The class which is exposed to the user and takes in the user details.

Static methods have been used in the project in order to make the code more efficient and reduce the number of lines.
